# Issue: TDD

## OUTPUT FORMAT

````markdown
Part of #<requirement_issue_number>

# Sprint N — Technical Design Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
<2–3 sentences: gap/pain, why now>

### Goals
- <What user gains>

---

## 2. Architectural Design

### High-Level Diagram
<Mermaid: services, databases, caches, third-party>

### Integration Flows

#### Happy Path
<Mermaid sequence: user → services → storage → response>

#### Unhappy Path
<Mermaid sequence: failure scenario, system response>

### Technology Stack
<New languages/frameworks/libraries/infrastructure>

### Components Design
<Mermaid: internal component structure>

### Infrastructure Design
<AWS services, networking, deployment topology — Mermaid or N/A>

---

## 3. Data & Interface Contracts

### Data Models
<ERD or JSON schema, include indexes>

### API Specification
| Method | Route | Auth | Request Body | Response | Status Codes |

### Event Schemas
<Topic, event structure, producer, consumer, or N/A>

---

## 4. Risk & Trade-offs

### Alternatives Considered
| Decision | Chosen | Alternative | Why Rejected |

### Security
<Auth, authz, encryption>

### Scalability & Performance
<Throughput, latency targets, scaling strategy>

### Failure Modes
| Scenario | Impact | Mitigation |

---

## 5. Migration Plan

<Data migration, cutover, rollback>

### Monitoring & Alerting
<Metrics, thresholds>

---

## Implementation Priority

| Priority | Stories |
|----------|---------|
| P1 | #<story_number> |

> Each story appears in exactly one priority row.
